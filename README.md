# CUMA
Curriculum Mapping Aid (CuMA) is a curriculum mapping tool that serves as an archive of all Senate-approved learning outcomes at the University of Windsor. It facilitates the creation, revision, and submission of course and program learning outcomes, and aids in building curriculum maps to visualize how courses align with program outcomes.
